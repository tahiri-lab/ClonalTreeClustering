# ClonalTreeClustering

ClonalTreeClustering is part of a project to cluster B cell lineage trees.
The B cell lineage tree visually depicts the stages of B cell differentiation and maturation, illustrating the progression from hematopoietic stem cells to fully functional antibody-producing cells in the immune system. Accurate classification of these cells necessitates a reliable metric similar to that used for evolutionary trees. We introduce a systematic method for comparing B cell lineage trees, incorporating crucial parameters. This analytical framework enables the investigation of lineage changes over time and facilitates the comparison of B cell dynamics in clinical settings. By addressing the complex challenge of comparing multiple B cell lineage trees, our methodology enhances our understanding of immune system dynamics in disease contexts.

This repository contains the source code of ClonalTreeClustering as well as data for testing the code.
