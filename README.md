# ClonalTreeClustering

ClonalTreeClustering is part of a project to cluster B cell lineage trees.

The aim of ClonalTreeClustering is to read a Newick file containing lineage trees and construct a distance matrix between all pairs of nodes for each of the trees contained in the Newick file provided as input to the program. The program also builds a map containing abundance information for all nodes in each tree.

This repository contains the source code of ClonalTreeClustering as well as data for testing the code.
