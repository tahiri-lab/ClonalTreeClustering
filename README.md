# ClonalTreeClustering

ClonalTreeClustering is part of a project to cluster B cell lineage trees.

The objective of ClonalTreeClustering is to make it easier to read and store B cell line trees in a C++ data structure. It also aims to construct a matrix of distances between all pairs of nodes.

This repository contains the source code of ClonalTreeClustering as well as data for testing the code.
