# ClonalTreeClustering

ClonalTreeClustering is part of a project to cluster the trees of B cell lineage.

The objective of ClonalTreeClustering is to make it easier to read and store B cell line trees in a C++ data structure. It also aims to construct a matrix of distances between all pairs of nodes.
