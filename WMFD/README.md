# LineageTreeClustering

Building on the Generalized Branch Length Distance (GBLD), we introduce the Weighted Multi-Feature Distance (WMFD), a versatile semimetric designed for clustering lineage trees. This approach incorporates all key features of lineage trees, offering flexibility in determining the importance of each feature.

Key Features Evaluated:
1. Topology: Structural arrangement of the lineage tree.
2. Branch Length: Distance between nodes, representing mutations.
3. Weight: Relative repitation/abundance of nodes.
4. Height: Depth or vertical level of nodes within the tree.
5. Node Degree: Number of connections per node, reflecting clonal expansion.
