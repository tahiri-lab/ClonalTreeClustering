# ðŸ§« **LineageTreeClustering**  

## Overview  
The **LineageTreeClustering** program builds on the *Generalized Branch Length Distance (GBLD)* framework to introduce a novel metric: **Weighted Multi-Feature Distance (WMFD)**.  
This semimetric is specifically designed for clustering lineage trees by incorporating multiple key features of their structure. Its flexibility allows users to assign importance to each feature based on their specific research needs.

## ðŸ”‘ **Key Features Evaluated**  
1. **Topology**:  
   The structural arrangement of nodes and branches within the lineage tree.  
2. **Branch Length**:  
   The distance between nodes, which corresponds to the number of mutations.  
3. **Weight**:  
   The relative repetition or abundance of nodes, representing clonal frequency.  
4. **Height**:  
   The depth or vertical level of nodes within the tree, reflecting evolutionary progression.  
5. **Node Degree**:  
   The number of connections per node, indicative of clonal expansion.

## ðŸŒŸ **Why Choose WMFD?**  
- **Comprehensive**: Evaluates all major characteristics of lineage trees.  
- **Customizable**: Flexibility to prioritize specific features based on research goals.  
- **Biologically Relevant**: Captures essential dynamics of B cell clonal evolution and differentiation.
