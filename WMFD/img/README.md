# Images of the Project ðŸŒ„

This folder contains images related to the **WMFD** project. There are **7 images** in **SVG format** used in the project. 

### Files Included:

1. **image1.svg** â€“  [Branch length evaluation]
2. **image2.svg** â€“  [Topology comparison of two lineage trees]
3. **image3.svg** â€“  [evaluation of the height index for all nodes]
4. **image4.svg** â€“  [Penalization in lineage trees]
5. **image5.svg** â€“  [Topology of three lineage trees]
6. **image6.svg** â€“  [The WMFD evaluation process]
7. **image7.svg** â€“  [The topological structure of the simulated dataset]

These images are used to visualize various aspects of the **Weightem Multi-Feature Distance (WMFD)** metric and its application to immune system lineage tree clustering.
