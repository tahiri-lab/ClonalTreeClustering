# 🧑‍💻 **WMFD Calculation and Clustering** 🌳

This repository provides Python scripts for calculating the **Weighted Multi-Feature Distance (WMFD)** between tree pairs based on multiple metrics, followed by clustering the results using **DBSCAN**. The goal is to analyze similarities between phylogenetic trees based on different tree features, calculate distances between them, and apply clustering algorithms to group similar tree pairs.🧠🌲

## 🔍 **Features**

- 📏**WMFD Calculation**: 
  - The script computes the WMFD value between two trees by considering several metrics such as:
    - **Branch Length**
    - **Weight**
    - **Degree**
    - **Height**
    - **Topology**
  - The final WMFD is calculated based on these metrics and a penalty factor applied to the uncommon part.
  
- 🔢**Distance Matrix**:
  - The program creates a symmetric distance matrix from all tree pair comparisons.
  - Each entry represents the computed distance (WMFD) between two trees.

- 🔍**DBSCAN Clustering**:
  - **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** is used to cluster the trees based on the distance matrix.
  - Clusters are formed by evaluating tree distances, and any tree pair that exceeds a given threshold (epsilon) is clustered together.
  
- **User Inputs**:
  - The user can define the lambda values for each metric and specify DBSCAN parameters like `epsilon` (ε) and `minPoints` to control the clustering behavior.

- **Output**:
  - A text file containing:
    - The **distance matrix** between trees.
    - **Clustering results**, listing trees in each cluster.
  - This output provides insight into the relationships between the trees and groups them based on calculated distances.



## ⚙️ **Requirements**

Install necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## 📝 **Input Format**

- **CSV** with columns: 
  - `Tree_Pair`: A string representing the tree pair (e.g., `("Tree_1", "Tree_2")`)
  - `Normalized_Common_*`: The normalized values for metrics (e.g., `Normalized_Common_BL` for Branch Length).
  - `Normalized_Uncommon_*`: The normalized values for metrics in the uncommon part.
  - `Penalty`: A numerical value indicating the penalty applied to the uncommon part in the calculation.
  
  Example CSV:
  
  | Tree_Pair           | Normalized_Common_BL | Normalized_Common_Weight | Normalized_Uncommon_BL | Normalized_Uncommon_Weight | Penalty | ... |
  |---------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|---------|-----|
  | ("Tree_1", "Tree_2")| 0.75                 | 0.30                     | 0.50                   | 0.20                       | 1.5     | ... |
  | ("Tree_1", "Tree_3")| 0.85                 | 0.40                     | 0.60                   | 0.35                       | 1.2     | ... |



## 🚀 **How to Run**

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WMFD-Clustering.git
cd WMFD-Clustering
```

2. Ensure your input CSV is ready (or modify the `input_path` in the script to point to your file).

3. Run the script: 🖱️

```bash
python wmfd_clustering.py
```

4. Follow the prompts to enter the **lambda values** for each metric and the **DBSCAN parameters** (`epsilon` and `minPoints`). 📊

5. Check the generated **output text file** for the distance matrix and clustering results.




## 📤 **Output**

- **Distance Matrix**: A symmetric matrix of WMFD values between trees.
- **Clustering Results**: Clusters with tree members grouped by DBSCAN, with each cluster's tree members.
- **File Format**: Results will be saved in a `.txt` file with the following sections:
  - Parameters used (lambda values, DBSCAN parameters)
  - Distance matrix
  - Clustering results
