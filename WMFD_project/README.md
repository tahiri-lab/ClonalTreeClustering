#LineageTreeClustering

Building on the Generalized Branch Length Distance (GBLD), we introduce the Weighted Multi-Feature Distance (WMFD), a versatile semimetric designed for clustering lineage trees.
This approach incorporates all key features of lineage trees, offering flexibility in determining the importance of each feature.


Key Features Evaluated:
Topology: Structural arrangement of the lineage tree.
Branch Length: Distance between nodes, representing mutations.
Weight: Relative repitation/abundance of nodes.
Height: Depth or vertical level of nodes within the tree.
Node Degree: Number of connections per node, reflecting clonal expansion.
