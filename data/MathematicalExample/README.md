One small set of the newicks of 3 lineage trees is provided to show the steps to calculate the GBLD score between two lineage trees.

The output file contains the Normalized weights, differences of the normalized weights, averaged weight score based on the maximum number of nodes between two lineage trees under comparison, normalized branch length distances, penality, and finally GBLD score between each pair of lineage trees.
