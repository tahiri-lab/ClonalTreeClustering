# data-metrique

This folder contains :
   - the real-dataset folder containing 2 experimental datasets
     
   - the simulated-data folder containing 92 simulated trees obtained with GCtree simulator
     
   - a C++ program allowing to count and display the number of occurrences (abundance) of each of the sequences, as well as the total number of sequences


# real-dataset

We have here two files in fasta format containing nucleotide sequences.
These are 2 sets of experimental data:
     
- CLL-20.fasta :

   - this file was generated by sampling sequences from the most abundant clone in a monoclonal repertoire of CLL
   
   - there are 20 sequences + the naive sequence, the latter is unique, the 20 other sequences have an occurrence >= 1 : 3406 sequences in total
   
   - the sequences are aligned with each other


- TAS-42.fasta :

   - this file comes from a public database available on https://github.com/matsengrp/gctree/tree/master/example
   
   - there are 42 sequences + the naive sequence, the latter is unique, the 42 other sequences have an occurrence >= 1 : 66 sequences in total
   
   - the sequences are aligned with each other
                      
# simulated-data

This folder contains several files with a total of 92 simulated BCR lines obtained with the GCtree simulator available here: https://github.com/matsengrp/gctree

Each folder contains several fasta files corresponding to the BCR lineage tree, containing at most the same number of sequences as the folder name.

For each given lineage file "tree.fasta", there is :
   - the real tree "tree.naive.nk"

   - the tree infered by ClonalTree "tree.clonalTree.nk"
