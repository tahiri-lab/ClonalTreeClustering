# real-dataset

We have here two files in fasta format containing nucleotide sequences. These are 2 sets of experimental data.

## CLL-20.fasta

- this file was generated by sampling sequences from the most abundant clone in a monoclonal repertoire of CLL
- there are 20 sequences + the naive sequence, the latter is unique, the 20 other sequences have an occurrence >= 1: 3406 sequences in total


## TAS-42.fasta

- this file comes from a public database available on https://github.com/matsengrp/gctree/tree/master/example
- there are 42 sequences + the naive sequence, the latter is unique, the 42 other sequences have an occurrence >= 1: 66 sequences in total
