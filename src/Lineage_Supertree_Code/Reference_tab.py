def build_reference_matrix_from_nonfrequent_arcs(newick_list, frequent_arcs, verbose=True):
    """
    Constructs a pairwise similarity matrix between trees based on their shared **non-frequent arcs**.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    newick_list : list of str
        A list of tree representations in Newick format.

    frequent_arcs : set of (parent, child) tuples
        A set of arcs considered globally frequent and therefore excluded from the similarity calculation.

    verbose : bool
        If True, the function prints the resulting matrix to the console.

    Returns:
    --------
    matrix : numpy.ndarray
        A square (n x n) symmetric matrix where entry (i, j) indicates the number of non-frequent arcs shared
        between tree i and tree j. Diagonal entries are 0 by default (self-comparison is excluded).
