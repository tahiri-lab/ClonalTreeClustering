def Common_structure(trees, bipartitions, matrix, threshold_value):
    """
    Identifies the common structure across a set of phylogenetic trees by 
    extracting frequent bipartitions that occur in at least 'threshold_value' trees.

    Parameters
    ----------
    trees : list of str
        List of phylogenetic trees in Newick format.

    bipartitions : list of frozenset
        The full set of unique bipartitions observed across all trees.

    matrix : list of list of int
        Binary presence/absence matrix of shape (n_trees + 1, n_bipartitions), 
        where each row corresponds to a tree and each column to a bipartition.
        The last row contains the frequency (number of trees) in which 
        each bipartition appears.

    threshold_value : int
        Minimum number of trees in which a bipartition must appear to be 
        considered frequent (i.e., part of the common structure).

    Returns
    -------
    list of frozenset
        A list of bipartitions that represent the common structure, 
        i.e., bipartitions that appear in at least `threshold_value` trees.
